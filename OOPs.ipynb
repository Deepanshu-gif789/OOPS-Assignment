Each object contains data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data. OOP helps organize complex programs, making them easier to understand, reuse, and maintain."],"metadata":{"id":"goq_8VDn0VET"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. **What is a class in OOP?**\n","     - In Object-Oriented Programming, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.

It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. For example, when driving a car, you use the steering and pedals without needing to understand the engine's inner workings.\n","      - **Encapsulation** is the technique of wrapping data and the methods that operate on it into a single unit, called a class, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components. It focuses on protecting data by using access modifiers and provides controlled access through methods."],"metadata":{"id":"9QGGzWRQ1vjL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5. **What are dunder methods in Python?**\n","     - Dunder methods (short for “double underscore” methods) are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, and __len__. They are also known as magic methods. These methods are automatically called by Python in certain situations, allowing you to define how objects of your class behave with built-in functions and operators."],"metadata":{"id":"-KOBcQKJ3L0F"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. **Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**\n","    - Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows a class (called a child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods and attributes) from another class (called a parent or superclass).

It takes cls as the first parameter (instead of self) and can access or modify class variables.\n","       - **Static Method (@staticmethod)** - A static method is not bound to the class or instance.

It behaves like a regular function but resides inside the class for logical grouping.\n","         - **@classmethod** - Has a reference to the class: A @classmethod takes a reference to the class as its first argument (cls), not the instance (self).

It enables a single interface to be used for different underlying data types. In the context of inheritance, polymorphism is typically achieved by defining methods in a base class that can be overridden by child classes.\n","          - **How Polymorphism Works in Python with Inheritance:**\n","              - **Method Overriding**: A subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. This is called method overriding. When you call the method on an object of the subclass, the overridden version is executed, not the base class version.\n","              - **Dynamic Method Dispatch**: Python uses dynamic method dispatch to determine which method to call at runtime. When a method is called on an object, Python checks the object's type and calls the method that corresponds to that type. This allows different classes to provide their own behavior for the same method, making polymorphism possible."],"metadata":{"id":"lCbhmTgWEs6X"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["24. **What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n","      - Method chaining in Python, especially in the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code, one after another.
